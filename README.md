# Problem-Solving-Tricks-and-Techniques
## 1. How to find missing number from 1 to N array?
==> Do sum off all array values and subtract it from summation of N formula
## 2. If we have to find subarray whose sum is zero then 
==> if summmation of subarray gets repeat then we can say that there exist 0 summation pair. Prefix some property
## 3. All perfect squares have (2n+1) number of factors.
## 4. For most significant bit(MSB) use formula Math.floor(Math.log(11)/Math.log(2)).
## 5.Given a number N, the task is to find the XOR of all numbers from 1 to N
==> 1. Find the remainder of N by moduling it with 4.
2. If rem = 0, then xor will be same as N.
3. If rem = 1, then xor will be 1.
4. If rem = 2, then xor will be N+1.
5. If rem = 3 ,then xor will be 0.
